    "# Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using visualizations, I have explored questions from the dataset like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do students in more popular majors make more money?\n",
    "    - Using scatter plots\n",
    "- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?\n",
    "    - Using histograms\n",
    "- Which category of majors have the most students?\n",
    "    - Using bar plots"
