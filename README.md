# Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors

In this project I worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.

The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

### Using visualizations, I have explored questions from the dataset like:

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
    - Using scatter plots
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
    - Using histograms
- Which category of majors have the most students?
    - Using bar plots
